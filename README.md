grunt-sass-starter
==================

starter project for adding sass compilation

You can either clone this repo, or download as zip and add/rename for a new project

dependencies:

* ruby
* node

to run:

* bundle install (if your ruby doesn't have sass installed yet)
* npm install (once to add the node_modules)
* grunt

the task will watch any files matching sass/*.scss, and compile them to css/*
